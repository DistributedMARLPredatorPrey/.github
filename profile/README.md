# Distributed MARL Predator-Prey

*Distributed MARL Predator-Prey* is a microservice-based application that allows training a Predator-Prey MARL system.

Agents' experiences are collected from multiple parallel environments and integrated into a centralized dataset, ultimately used for the learning process.

The application also allows the user to simulate the Predator-Prey environment, if a previous training phase has been completed.

## Usage

Follow the instructions given at [Bootstrap](https://github.com/DistributedMARLPredatorPrey/bootstrap) repository to deploy the application.

## Video

A video example that the user can generate after a training/simulation process can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DistributedMARLPredatorPrey/.github/blob/main/profile/predator-prey-env-0-train.mp4).

## Report

The project report is available [here](https://github.com/DistributedMARLPredatorPrey/bootstrap/docs/report.pdf).
