# Distributed MARL Predator-Prey

*Distributed MARL Predator-Prey* is a microservice-based application that allows training multiple Predator-Prey MARL environments.

Using a data augmentation approach, agents' experiences are collected from multiple parallel environments and integrated into a centralized dataset, ultimately used for the learning process.

It also allows to simulate the Predator-Prey environment, if a previous training phase is completed.

## Usage
